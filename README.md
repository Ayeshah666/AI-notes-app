You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `READ!`
to be honest i am not sure about this project, i just had an idea in my brain for too long to create my own AI notes app where i could
- write notes with titles
- have a grammer checker
- and a small ai model that would assist me with writing

i am still learning and will try to do better on this one because i am not yet satisfied with what i did but i wanted to try front end and backend myself, a little ecxperience to gain some knowledge and there is no doubt i got to learn about many things, i continue this project for 4 days but then i eventually give up on it and decided to focus on other stuff.
i'll come back to this project late :)
